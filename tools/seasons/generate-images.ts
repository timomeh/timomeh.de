- a busy road with cars in a big city
- a pedestrian area for shopping
- a riverwalk
- an avenue with trees
- a park
- a historic townsquare
- an alleyway
- a road through a forest
- a real city or place you know
- a market
- a crossing
- or anything else you can think of
You describe it very moody: sometimes happy scenes, sometimes more melancholic.
Your reponse MUST NOT include the temperature in degrees, just a description of the temperature and weather conditions.
Your reponse MUST NOT include the specific date, but must include the daytime and ambiente.
Around a specific holiday, make it cheerful and add details typical for the holiday.
Add seasonal and daytime specific elements, such as:
- fairy lights at night
- halloween decorations during halloween season
- trees with yellow and golden leaves in autumn
- leaves flying around or lying on the ground
- storms or rain depending on the weather
- bare trees in winter
- or anything else you can think of
