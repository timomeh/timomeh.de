# Hi, Iâ€™m Timo ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Timo MÃ¤mecke, online sometimes known as [@timomeh](https://mastodon.social/@timomeh).
I am a Software Engineer from Germany, and Frontend Engineering Lead at [Gigs](https://gigs.com/).

I have a past of building Blogs and wanting to publish content, but barely writing anything.
[I found the issue](https://timomeh.de/posts/how-to-build-a-blog) and this
version of my blog solves this issue.

If you want to reach out to me, you can do so via [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@timomeh), [GitHub](https://github.com/timomeh/timomeh.de/discussions/new?category=ask-me) or [Email](mailto:hello@timomeh.de).
